            This space isn’t for people still partying. It’s for the ones who <strong>walked away</strong>,
            swear they’re “done with it,” but quietly know:
          </p>
          <ul class="hero-list">
            <li>You don’t feel as alive, sharp, or driven as the “high version” of you.</li>
            <li>You still think about the edge it gave you — especially when life gets heavy.</li>

            Stopping the drug is <strong>step one</strong>. Reclaiming the <em>parts of you it pretended to be</em> — confidence, focus,
            social spark, drive — is the real work.

        <div class="panel hero-slim">
          <h2>What The Drug Really Did (Beyond “Getting You High”)</h2>
          <p class="hero-text">
            You already know the obvious parts: heart, nose, money, risk. This is about the parts nobody explained —
            the ones you feel now, sober, but can’t quite name.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel">
          <h3>1. It didn’t just change how you felt. It rewired what your brain calls “important.”</h3>
          <p>
            That drug hijacks your brain’s <strong>salience system</strong> — the bit that decides what matters.
            On it, intense, fast, risky, ego-heavy situations light up as “important”. Quiet, slow, ordinary moments go dim.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you stop, you don’t just lose the high. You’re left with a brain that’s trained to treat
            normal life as “not enough.” That’s why things feel flat, even if everything is technically okay.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel">
          <h3>2. It helped you build a fake “best self” — then took it away.</h3>
          <p>
            Many people didn’t use it “just for fun.” They used it to become a version of themselves they thought
            they couldn’t be sober: sharper, quicker, more confident, more ruthless, more social.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem: your brain bonded with that version of you. It quietly labelled it as
            <strong>“who I am when I’m finally enough.”</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            When you stop, your nervous system grieves that counterfeit identity — even if consciously you’re proud to be done.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel">
          <h3>3. It distorted how you read other people.</h3>
          <p>
            On that drug, you start seeing people less as humans and more as <strong>stimulus sources</strong>:
            validation, status, sex, power, attention, energy. Relationships shift from mutual connection
            to subtle extraction, performance, and gaming.
          </p>
          <p>
            After stopping, some of that lens remains. You might feel disconnected, mistrustful, or weirdly
            uninterested in people unless they’re intense. That isn’t “just your personality.” That’s residue.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel panel-accent">
          <h3>4. It trained your body to crave extremes.</h3>
          <p>
            Even if you never touch it again, your nervous system remembers the pattern:
            <strong>flat → pressure → high intensity → crash → repeat</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So you may now unconsciously chase the same cycle through:
          </p>
          <ul class="bullet">
            <li>work overload and burnout,</li>
            <li>fights / drama,</li>
            <li>risk, gambling, or impulsive decisions,</li>
            <li>doom-scrolling or porn or anything high-stimulus.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That’s not “random bad choices.” It’s your body recreating the old rhythm without the white powder.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel panel-sub">
          <h3>5. So no — stopping didn’t mean it left you completely.</h3>
          <p>
            You can be fully sober and still be:
          </p>
          <ul class="bullet">
            <li>running a life built on its logic,</li>
            <li>missing the edge more than you admit,</li>
            <li>unconsciously attracted to people who still use it,</li>
            <li>stuck in its emotional architecture without realising.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That’s the part this page is designed to name — not to shame you, but to give you your mind back.

          <h3>Phase 3 · Rewrite your identity story</h3>

            The drug isn’t just a chapter. For a while, it was a <strong>co-author</strong> of your personality.
            So you’ll need a new story about who you are now:
          </p>
          <ul class="bullet">
            <li>Who are you when you’re fully sober and fully expressed?</li>

          </ul>
          <p>

          <h3>Where this fits in HelpToHeal</h3>
          <p>
            This whole build is the <strong>free front gate</strong>: a clean mirror and a nervous-system map.
            Deeper work — whether with therapists, groups, or future HelpToHeal modules —
            sits behind this kind of honesty.

            You’re already ahead of most people just by reading this sober and letting it land.
